# "Okaru" A Discord Bot for Kitsu #
Okaru is used to get Anime/Manga and User profile information from [Kitsu.io](http://kitsu.io) and display this info on your Discord Server.
Made with the [node-kitsu](https://github.com/the-conceptionist/node-kitsu) Node Package made by [The Conceptionist](https://github.com/the-conceptionist).

## Version: 0.0.2
The Bot is only able to search up anime at this time, but with this version a command cooldown has been added. 

## Usage
The bots current prefix is set to ~{Anime Name}, this will most likely be changed to ~anime {Anime Name}, ~manga {Manga Name} and ~profile {Profile Name}
in the future when more functionality is added.

For Version 0.0.1 its just the anime name (Both English and Rōmaji)
```
~{Anime Name}
```
As seen here, searching with the English Title:

Or the Rōmaji Title:

And if you search for something and the bot gets an empty response from Kitsu you will recieve this message:
